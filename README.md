# MIPS and its assembly language
MIPS, which stands for Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages, is a 32-bit Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) microprocessor. RISC indicates that it has a reduced set of instructions; however, in return, it is capable of completing the execution of an instruction in each clock cycle. MIPS processors are commonly used in workstations (such as Silicon Graphics and DEC), various embedded systems (Palm, modems), as well as in TV, HiFi, and video devices, printers, routers, automotive applications, and numerous gaming consoles (Nintendo 64, Sony PlayStation 2, etc.).

# MIPS emulator implemented in C
In the context of my C language learning at an engineering school in France, I had to undertake a project at the end of the semester, which involved creating an emulator for a MIPS microprocessor. I enjoyed this project a lot because it was the first one I had to complete in engineering school, and also because I have a passion for C programming. For details on using my emulator, I invite you to read the documentation I wrote for this project.
